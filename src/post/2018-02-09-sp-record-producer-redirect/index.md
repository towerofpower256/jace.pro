So the other day I was asked to set up the redirect from a record
producer on the Service Portal. This was no problem in the past CMS, and
the normal GUI.\
The
[docs](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-it-service-management/page/product/service-catalog-management/concept/c_PopulatingRecordData.html)
say it should just be a simple line of code like;

```js
producer.url_redirect="home.do";//for CMS and GUI redirects
producer.portal_redirect="?id=page";//for Service Portal redirects
```

However this *does not* work unless you modify the Instance Options
(control-right click, to get to "Instance Options").

This however is the same widget that renders your other catalog items
and all of them will redirect too.
